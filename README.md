# freeCodeCamp Backend Development Journey

## Managing Packages with NPM

This repository tracks my progress through freeCodeCamp's "Back End Development and APIs" certification, specifically the "Managing Packages with NPM" section.

### Progress Summary (15 May 2025)

I've completed the entire "Managing Packages with NPM" section in one day, including:

* Setting up the initial boilerplate project
* Adding author information to package.json
* Adding project description and keywords
* Setting proper licence information 
* Adding version number
* Understanding the Express.js dependency configuration
* Working with npm dependencies
* Learning semantic versioning (SemVer)
* Managing dependency versions with tilde (~) and caret (^) characters
* Removing packages from dependencies

### Section Completed ✓

All challenges in this section are now complete. The changes were minimal but vital for understanding how NPM and package.json function in Node.js projects. 

Since the modifications were limited to a few lines in the package.json file, this repository serves more as documentation of learning rather than demonstrating complex code.

### Next Steps

I'll be moving directly to the "Basic Node and Express" section of the certification, which will involve creating servers and handling various HTTP requests. A new repository will be created for that more substantial project.

The complete certification path I'm following includes:

1. Managing Packages with NPM (✓ COMPLETED)
2. Basic Node and Express (NEXT)
3. MongoDB and Mongoose
4. Backend APIs and Microservices Projects

## Skills Acquired

* Node.js package.json configuration
* npm command line basics
* Understanding dependency management
* Semantic versioning principles
* JSON structure best practices

*This repository demonstrates my systematic approach to learning foundational web technologies as I build toward my ultimate goal of becoming an AI engineer. Understanding backend systems and APIs is crucial for developing and deploying robust AI applications.*
