# freeCodeCamp Backend Development Journey

## Managing Packages with NPM

This repository tracks my progress through freeCodeCamp's "Back End Development and APIs" certification, specifically the "Managing Packages with NPM" section.

### Today's Progress (14 May 2025)

* Set up the initial boilerplate for the NPM package management challenge
* Successfully completed the first few challenges:
  * Added author information to package.json
  * Added project description
  * Added keywords for better searchability
  * Added licence information
  * Updated version number
* Learned about the importance of package.json as the core configuration file for Node.js projects
* Gained experience with Express.js configuration

### Tomorrow's Goals

* Complete the remaining NPM challenges:
  * Working with npm dependencies
  * Using semantic versioning (SemVer)
  * Managing dependency versions with tilde (~) and caret (^) characters
  * Removing packages from dependencies

### Project Overview

This is a short project focused specifically on learning NPM package management fundamentals. While simple, it covers essential skills required for any Node.js development:

* Configuring and maintaining package.json
* Managing dependencies
* Understanding semantic versioning
* Best practices for Node.js project structure

### Next Steps

After completing this module, I'll move on to the "Basic Node and Express" section of the certification, which will involve creating servers and handling various HTTP requests. I'll create a new repository called "basic node express" to track that progress.

The complete certification path I'm working through includes:

1. Managing Packages with NPM (current)
2. Basic Node and Express
3. MongoDB and Mongoose
4. Backend APIs and Microservices Projects

## Skills Demonstrated

* Node.js package management
* npm command line usage
* JSON configuration
* Understanding of dependency management
* Express.js configuration
